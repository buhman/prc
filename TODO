* Add 'buffer' (and logging) support

    Implementation is planned to be via memory-mapped file access, one
    file for each buffer. (Active) buffer output would be not only
    written to the terminal, but also to said memory-mapped (log)
    file.

    This also implies the ability to perform complete redraws of
    contents upon TE resize events/etc.. in addition to redraws
    necessary to switch terminal output between buffers.

* Handle signals (SIGINT)

    The signal handler would utilize an eventfd to inform the epoll
    loop of this change, so that it can make the appropriate decisions
    regarding any cleanup of other open file descriptors and write
    queues.

* Plugin unload/reload

    The primary purpose of the plugin architecture has always been to
    allow addition of arbitrary functionality without necessitating a
    new instance of prc be compiled/started.

    The implementation would involve both a symbol-unloading and
    (automated?) un-registration procedure, followed by the loading of
    said new DSO.

* Runtime configuration

    Currently most "configuration" such as credentials, servers to
    connect to, channels to join, etc.. are hard-coded in prc sources;
    these rather common things should be moved to a separate
    runtime-modifiable configuration file.

* World Domination
